## Dashboard

You can see the overal dahsboard above. The dahsboard allows key 
stakeholders to filter the content in many different ways which 
includes filtering by:

1. Movies or TV Shows
2. Country
3. Rating category
3. Genre

This tyoe of filtering allows stakeholders to drill down into very 
specific areas of the data in order to get a better understanding 
of how content is performing overal. An example would be to see 
how the romance genre is performing in France. Drilling down to such 
a granular would allow one ro understand the rating distribution 
of the content among movies or tv shows.

I used an Azure map visual to allow filtering by just clicking 
on a specific country. The map also gets filtered by the 
selection of other visuals. 

## Data

I replicated this project step-by-step on my own as a way to learn more 
about the capabilities of Power BI.
